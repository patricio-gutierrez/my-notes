# Unix/Linux

## Concepts

- **Command Prompt**: Short text at the start of the command line followed by a prompt symbol. The first part is the username followed by the hostname and last the prompt symbol.
- `Ctrl + C` : Brings your prompt back if stuck.
- Linux has a super-user account call **root**. The root has permission to modify everything.
- Linux is **case sensitive**.
- Avoid using spaces when creating files and directories.
- _Linux filesystem_ store information in a hierarchy of directories and files.
